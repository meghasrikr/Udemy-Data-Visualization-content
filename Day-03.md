How to import the different types of files in Power BI Desktop?
    This can be done through connecting the type of file with Power BI.

In this session we can able to learn three diff types of file connections with Power BI Desktop;
1.) Text/CSV (Comma Seperated Values) - Opening the csv file and check whether it has any error by tranform data. Then if there is no error, we close&apply it and view the data.
2.) SQL Database - We can connect the sql data with the help of PG admin, then to connect with Power BI Desktop,need to insert the database name and can able to connect it.
3.) XML File - The XML file can be connected as like the Text/CSV file method.

Atlast, it all shows the relationship between them.
